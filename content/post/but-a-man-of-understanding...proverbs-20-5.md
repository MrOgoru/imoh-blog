**_Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, But a man of understanding will draw it out._** 

**_Proverbs 20:5_** 

This verse reveals the importance of "COUNSEL" in the heart of (any) man, not in any other place. Counsel is like DEEP WATERS  when it has entered into the heart of (any) man already. 

\[The exchange of opinions and advice; guidance. Deliberate purpose; design; intent; scheme; plan. A secret opinion or purpose; a private matter.\] 

This COUNSEL is not that of the evil, but that of the better. 

It is not found at the surface; 

It is not seen all around; 

It is not given by just any other person or all people around; 

It is not received by all. Many will reject it. 

Although COUNSEL is crucial to our relevance and Life, so much that it's seen as "deep water" that never runs dry, it is however neither drawn nor received by all. It'll be rejected by many.

But those who understand it's worth and grasp it and meditate on it and apply it is referred to as "A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING!" 

The prerequisites for drawing out COUNSEL is UNDERSTANDING! 

The receiving of COUNSEL is therefore directly proportional to your UNDERSTANDING COUNSEL!

Until you are a Man of understanding, you cannot draw it out. 

Although COUNSEL is not forced on people, it can be pleaded and suggested to people to receive it. 

 We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain." 

2 Corinthians 6:1

There are counsels for your Marriage, Career, Ministry, etc; but there is The COUNSEL that is required to be applied for the right result to come forth. But ONLY A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING will discern and benefit from it. For there to be SUCCESS, UNDERSTANDING of The COUNSEL (knowledge) is required! 

This is A Man of UNDERSTANDING - Discernment; Reasoning or intelligence, ability to grasp the full meaning of knowledge (COUNSEL), to draw; deduce, or produce what's rightly in The Mind of The Father through the agency of The Holy Ghost! 

Are you a man (person) of UNDERSTANDING? 

How often do you discern or grasp the mind of The Father for your spouse, relationships, marriage, colleagues, ministry, business, and Purpose? 

Do you Understand your "Partner" in every aspect? 

How much do you Understand your "Partner" in every situation?

Can your spouse say I know my "Partner" (especially the men) is a person of UNDERSTANDING?  

Now, 

Do you know that everyone draws out something? 

Do you know that everyone draws from somewhere? 

But You, 

WHERE DO YOU DRAW FROM?

WHAT DO YOU DRAW OUT?

COUNSEL is sure to be appreciated, applied, and be fruitful if only it is unto a Man of UNDERSTANDING. 

The Counsellor is rest assured that it'll never be a wasted effort and time. Such a Man is a Blessing and Joy to his/her Partner. 

These are the kind of Men that GOD desires to raise in order to fulfill His Promises in Relationships and Marriages and in all other aspects. 

As you strive to be A MAN OF UNDERSTANDING, The Holy Ghost will release Grace upon Grace unto you in the Mighty Name of JESUS CHRIST! You're a Blessing to your generation and your impacts shall be great in the Mighty Name of JESUS CHRIST.
