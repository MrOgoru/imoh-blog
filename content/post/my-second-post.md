Inside of you is The Seed of becoming all that’s expected of you to become. Although it doesn’t shout, it makes you so uncomfortable with the present (achievements and success); and steers you into emerging as What’s in you.

> God is able to raise a generation from a seed
> **Note** God is able to make you great. Wait upon the Lord. He will help you
