Defending one’s case is a crucial matter that must be carefully handled and requires the best personnel, lest both the defender and defendant will lose and be disgraced. Nonetheless, there is One who has never lost any case whatsoever – that is, GOD!

If the whole world decides your case, resist you on every sides, and even declare your doom right to your face, I’ve realised that, if GOD Almighty Rises to Assist YOU, to be your defence and shield, and to show HIS AWESOMENESS upon your life, then you sincerely have Nothing whatsoever to worry about…!

He’ll So fight for You while you hold your peace! And guess what, when God fights your fight for you, even you will so pity your opponents – you’ll be the one reminding GOD of His mercies…!

Exodus 14:14
  The LORD will fight for you, and you shall hold your  peace.” 

Romans 8:31
What then shall we say to these things? If God  is for  us, who can be against us?
