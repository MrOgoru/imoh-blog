I’ve found a few tips that I consider a MUST READ for every man. Please read through, comment and share.

A Man must understand that he is first, a Husband, Father and Priest (Pastor) of his family before he is anything else out there!

1. A First Class degree won’t make you a first class husband, rather, your love and affection will.

2. The man who love his wife and shows affection to his wife is the best husband anyone would ever have.

3. Your love, character and attitude will go a long way in determining whether your wife will wish she never regret getting married to you.

4. To be a great husband, you need more anger management skills than beating skills.

5. Be a leader at work or anywhere else, but be a companion at home… It’s wisdom.

6. Don’t compete with your wife, and don’t feel intimidated with her success/achievements – complement her.

7. Your strength is in love, affection and attention, not in strife and contention.

8. Be loving, tender, and firm, every woman respect such a man.

9. Never punish your wife by starving her of love, affection, attention, (& food or sex), she may be forced to get it outside.

10. There is nothing wrong in accepting that you are wrong when you are wrong.

11. Prepare to forgive your wife if she wrongs you. For a forgiving husband is better than a vengeful man.

12. ALWAYS Make a decision to be a good husband, you will need it in the long run…

MAY GOD BLESS ALL MEN BOTH MARRIED AND UNMARRIED.

Have a blessed day.
